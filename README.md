# MERNSocialMedia
Basic social media app built using MERN tech stack

This is something I threw together to get more familiar with the MERN stack

As the stack implies, it uses Express and Mongo for the backend with a react frontend
It is not complete, but most functionality is there and it has served it's purpose as a learning tool

Do not judge me for design pls :(
